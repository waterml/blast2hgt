Blast2hgt
------
Determine horizontal transfer candidates based on sequence similarity,
and reconstruct a phylogenetic tree to confirm the horizontal transfer event.

The query objects can be proteins, genes or partitial genomic sequences.   

**Note:** A nucleotide database (e.g., nt) is required for genes/nucleotide sequences,   
and a protein database (e.g., nr) is required for protein sequences.   

**See `Blast2hgt_manual.pdf` for user guide.**
